 * Title: SnmpTrapSenderFacade<br>
 * Description: A simplified interface to an underlying SNMP API.<p>
 * The intent of this class is both to limit the available interface, and allow
 * the underlying SNMP library to be changed, as desired.<br>
 * @author Mark Masterson (<a href="mailto:m.masterson@computer.org">m.masterson@computer.org</a>)<br>
 * <a href="http://www.m2technologies.net/">http://www.m2technologies.net/</a><br>
 * @version 1.0.2
 * changes ---<br>
 *
 * 2002-10-15: mwm : changed the sysUpTime value to a long, to cope with the SysUpTimeResolver mechanism.<br>
 *
 * 2003-05-24: mwm : changed the method signature of the SnmpTrapSenderFacade interface to use the Appender
 * as a single parameter object -- this makes the method more flexible against changes to the set of
 * parameters or interest in the future.<br>
