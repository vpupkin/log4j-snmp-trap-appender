/**
 * This layout allows you to embed trap specific OID's in the <b>conversion pattern</b> defined in the
 * configuration script, assigning each embedded OID to a specific element of the LoggingEvent.  Each element
 * obtained this way will be appended as a separate VarBind to the trap's PDU.  Thus, you can have the
 * Level (DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, etc.) as one VarBind, the logging message as another, the class name, or date,
 * or whatever, as yet more..  Each VarBind thus defined will typically be displayed by the SNMP managment
 * application that receives the trap as a discrete element -- this makes the trap much more readable and
 * can dramatically increase the usefulness of the appender.<br>
 * <br>
 * When using this Layout class, the appender assumes that the conversion pattern string in the
 * properties file will be in the following format: <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>(LoggingEvent element)(Value of the <code>varDelim</code> parameter of this class)(trap OID)(Value of the
 * <code>valuePairDelim</code> parameter of this class)</b>....(pattern repeats n+ times).<br>
 * <br>
 * ... where value pairs of conversion characters and applicationTrapOIDs are delimited
 * by the <code>valuePairDelim</code> variable (defined in log4j config, default is <b>/</b>).  Within
 * these value pairs the values are delimited by the <code>varDelim</code> variable (defined in
 * log4j config, default is <b>;</b>). <br>
 * <br>
 * Each conversion character is then formatted into the specific logging
 * information data it represents.  It is then bound to the SNMP PDU as a VarBind,
 * with the applicationTrapOID as the name, and the logging data string as the value...<br>
 * <br>
 * Thus, in the following example:<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>
 * "p;1.3.6.1.4.1.24.100.1/%m;1.3.6.1.4.1.24.100.2/%C;1.3.6.1.4.1.24.100.3"<br>
 * </b>
 *  <br>
 * ... the "p" element of the LoggingEvent (the Level) is mapped with the OID "1.3.6.1.4.1.24.100.1" to a
 * discrete VarBind, the "m" element of the LoggingEvent (the message) is mapped with the OID
 * "1.3.6.1.4.1.24.100.2" to another discrete VarBind, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Version 1.0.1<br>
 * 2001-09-29<br>
 * changes ---
 *
 * 2003.03.23: mwm : moved the #formatMultipleVarBinds method from the Appender, where it didn't seem
 * to belong, to this class.  Given the details of the task that this method resolves, and the means
 * that it uses to do so, it seems a better fit as a responsibility of this class.<br>
